    I created the clip above to demonstrate some of the interactive features of the MetConnect International platform
    (note: there is no sound).

<p>
    During my first six months at the MetService I worked on the MetConnect
    International project. We developed a new commercial product suite and delivery platform to aid the companyâ€™s
    expansion into the Australian market. I did double duty on this project working as both the sole UX designer and a
    developer. The user experience we created, transformed the product from its traditional page based structure, to a
    highly customisable interactive delivery platform. The product was built using leading edge web technologies with a
    java and Spring MVC backend.
