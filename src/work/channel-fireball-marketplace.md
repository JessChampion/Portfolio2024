summary: A marketplace for leading Trading Card Games
---

## Objectives

ChannelFireball Marketplace was built to support hobby game stores by providing a trading platform for collectible trading card games.
The platform allows retailers to create and customise a profile which represents their store brand and to upload or sync their inventory.
Buyers are then able to order from multiple stores in a single transaction, with security of knowing the stores are vetted by the platform.
